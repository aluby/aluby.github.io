::: {#hero-heading}
I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Carleton College and a researcher with the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019. Prior to Carleton, I taught at Swarthmore College for five years.

I primarily work on statistical methods for understanding complex decision-making, often using Bayesian tools. Right now, my work focuses on adapting and advocating for Item Response Theory-flavored models for forensic science, particularly in fingerprint analysis.

I'm also interested in statistics pedagogy, particularly in trying to better understand (and fix!) misconceptions among introductory students, and better integrating computing, applications, and theory in upper-level courses.

I'm always seeking new collaborations in the social and criminal justice space. Please get in touch if you'd like to work together on a quantitative project in this realm!

I use she/her pronouns, and my last name is pronounced "loo-bee".
